# Customer Segmentation using KMeans

Customer Segmentation is the methodology of grouping customers based on various characteristics such as gender,age, spending habits,interests demographics etc for forming specific relevant marketing groups. 

A business can greatly benefit from identifying and differentiating their customer base. They can understand, group and manage customers effectively. They can maximise sales by targeting individuals and businesses appropriately. Furthermore, they can provide more tailored  shopping experiences. Necessary steps can be taken to reduce the return of purchased items amongst specific customer groups as well.

Another use case can be for determining the target audience for the launch of a new product in the market.
